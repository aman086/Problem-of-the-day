/*

Given a number N.Find the maximum possible LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.
Note- LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple. Also, Numbers can be repeated.


Input:
N=9
Output:
504
Explanation:
504 is the maximum LCM that can be attained
by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 9.
The triplet which has this LCM is {7,8,9}.


Input:
N=7
Output:
210
Explanation:
210 is the maximum LCM that can be attained
by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 7.
The triplet which has this LCM is {5,6,7}.
