 /*
 
 Given a positive number n. 
 You need to write a program to find the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the LCM of all these numbers is equal to n.

Input: n = 2
Output: 3 
Explanation: The distinct numbers you can have are 
just 1 and 2 and their sum is equal to 3.

Input: n = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The distinct numbers you can have 
are just 1 and 5 and their sum is equal to 6.
