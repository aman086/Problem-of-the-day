/*
Shreyansh has an integer N. He is really curious about the binary representation of integers. He sees that any given integer has a number of set bits. Now he wants to find out that how many positive integers, strictly less than N, have the same number of set bits as N.
He is a little weak in maths. Help him find the number of integers.
Note : Since N takes large values, brute force won't work.

Input:
N = 8
Output: 3
Explanation:
Binary representation of 8 : 1000
So the integers less than 8 with 
same number of set bits are : 4, 2, 1
Hence, the result is 3. 


Input:
N = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
Binary representation of 4 : 100
So the integers less than 4 with 
same number of set bits are : 2, 1
So, The result is 2.
